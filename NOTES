    An Artist can have multiple songs and multiple genres
     Genre>- Artist -< Song

    A Genre can have multiple artists and multiple songs
      Song >- Genre -< Artist

    A Song can belong to ONE Artist and multiple genres
      Artist - Song -< genre

    How would we implement the relationship of a song having many genres and genre having many songs? In order to establish a "many-to-many" relationship, we'll need a join table. You will need a SongGenre class to go along with this table in the database
      Song >-< Genre
      SongGenre

 artist has genres through songs
 a genre has songs and artists through song_genre
 a song has many genres throgh song_genres
